Hey!I am Divya, a first year CSE student at IIT Guwahati. I like playing badminton,
reading novels and I recently discovered I like coding too.


I want to contribute to open source because I feel, this way, I can help modify the source code for various existing websites or projects for their betterment and help bring out changes in it which can help them and their users too. Also I can improve my skills too through this by learning from others' code.

ps-this is my first repository!
